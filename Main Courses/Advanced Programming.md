The purpose of this lesson is to explore different ways to produce a quality program. In this regard, after covering the top-down design method for problem-solving, students are introduced to the concepts of object-oriented programming as a tool for complexity management in medium and large-sized applications. Throughout the lesson, you will focus on the proper functioning of the test and debugging program, which is achieved through methods such as unit tests, assertions, and pre-and multiple conditions. The emphasis of the lesson will be on methods rather than the advantages of a particular programming language. This lesson can be presented in any common object-oriented programming language, such as Java with C++.

### At the end of the module students are able to:

    \item Solve problems with the top-down design method
    \item Manages the complexity of the programming problem by defining appropriate classes
    \item Appropriate abstraction methods such as inheritance and polymorphism are used
    \item They use the essential features of programming language libraries
    \item Ability to use the necessary methods to test and debug the program
