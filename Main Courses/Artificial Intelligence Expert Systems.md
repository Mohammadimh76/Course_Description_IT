Artificial intelligence is one of the essential branches of computer science; the ultimate goal is to model humans' intelligence and brilliant performance. AI itself includes a wide range of sub-disciplines, including general topics.
Leaper focuses on machine learning and various concepts to more specific topics such as playing chess, automatic proof of mathematical theorems, and diagnosis of diseases. In this course, while presenting the basic concepts of artificial intelligence, including various methods of searching and displaying knowledge, some sub-branches of artificial intelligence are also briefly introduced.
