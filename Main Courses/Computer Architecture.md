
# Computer Architecture

The purpose of this course is to acquaint computer engineering students with the architecture and organization of processors, which includes familiarity with instructional architecture and the internal structure of the processor. Students will also become familiar with computer calculations used in general-purpose processors, including displaying numbers and basic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in various numerical systems. The following is the hierarchy of memory in processing systems. Since modeling and testing of different architectures, which is one of the lesson's objectives, is possible by using hardware description languages, the use of Verilog language and recall of its basic concepts while teaching the class is recommended.
