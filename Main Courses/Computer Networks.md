This course examines the principles of design, implementation, and performance of computer networks. In this course, students will be introduced to the architecture and services of computer networks and the Layda model. This course focuses on Internet networks and the TCP / IP model to examine application layer protocols. It deals with the transport layer, the network layer and the data link layer.
