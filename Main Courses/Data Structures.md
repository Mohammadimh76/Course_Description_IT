Theoretical and practical exercises deepen the knowledge imparted to be able to design, analyze and implement data structures and algorithms yourself or to be able to use them sensibly in your programs. Students learn how the choice of a data structure affects the performance and usability of applications, e.g., in web browsing and searching, computer databases, data analysis, text processing, etc. Specific topics include lists, stacks, queues, sets, maps, priority queues, trees, and graphs, together with general algorithmic techniques, such as sorting, searching, and other transformations on data. Students who complete the course can use these tools to design and develop efficient programs for a wide variety of applications.
