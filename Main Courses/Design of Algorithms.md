The purpose of this course is to teach methods of analysis and design of algorithms. In this lesson, students learn how to analyze a problem and find a variety of possible algorithms to solve it. Then find algorithmic solutions based on each type, analyze and compare them in terms of computational complexity, and select the best one for a specific engineering application based on the size and input characteristics of the problem. In this course, basic algorithms for solving practical and common problems will be presented to students.
