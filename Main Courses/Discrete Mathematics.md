The purpose of this course is to acquaint students with the concepts, structures, and techniques of discrete mathematics that | Widely used in computer science and engineering. Develop basic skills, including understanding and building accurate mathematical proofs, creative thinking in problem-solving. Familiarity with the initial results in number theory, logical. Combinations and graph theory and the mathematical prerequisites required for many of the other courses offered in various computer engineering majors are among the objectives of this course.
