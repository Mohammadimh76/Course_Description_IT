The purpose of this course is to develop the ability to read fluently and understand English texts in computer engineering and information technology and, to some extent, to understand scientific lectures in this field. This course tries to improve the student's skills by relying on continuous exercises in reading and writing and listening to scientific lectures in English.

### At the end of the module, students are able to:

- Ability to read a technical text of computer engineering with medium complexity fluently
- Relatively good understanding of the meaning of the text at the same time as reading the text
- Relative understanding of technical lectures in the field of computer engineering
- Ability to write simple technical texts with appropriate speed
