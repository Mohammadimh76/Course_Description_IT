The purpose of this course is to acquaint students with the basics of computer and programming. After learning the basic structure of the machine and the basics of computing in hardware, students become familiar with organizing the components of a modern computer. Another emphasis of this course on programming in java is writing engineering code (tweed modular, clean code, commenting, spacing, and the ability to implement pseudocode).
