Practical acquaintance with the concepts presented in logic circuit and computer architecture courses such as digital circuit design, how to analyze and debug them. Design the logical and arithmetic parts of a processor design memory units, input / output, and data path and control in a typical processor, use hard descriptive languages Software such as Verilog and VHDL to describe the simulation, synthesis and finally implementation in the section on FPGA boards at the gate and RTL abstraction level.
