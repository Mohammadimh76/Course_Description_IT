### At the end of the module, students are able to:

- Practical familiarity and ability to work with microprocessors
- Design hardware and software and build systems based on microprocessors and microcontrollers


### Course Objectives:

- Familiarity with a simulation software (such as Proteus for simulation and testing, familiarity with a printed circuit board design software (such as Altium software) for schematic and PCB design, and finally doing a simple electronic project. It can design and simulate a flashing circuit with two LEDs (unstable multi-vibrator circuit) and its schematic and PCB design, rolling order and assembly of parts on PCB and soldering and testing it. The final laboratory project will be used.
- Introduction to microcontroller assemblers and compilers (such as Atmel Studio and CodeVision) 
- Construction of reset circuit programming cable, fuse bit programming, clock signal generation for microcontroller
- Prepare reset interrupt program, set stack pointer, work with ports, polling a base of a software delay generation port, and work with guard timer
- working with external interrupts and using power saving modes
- working with value reading ports specified by a four-bit Djp-Switch connected to a port Converting the read value to BCD Converting BCD digits to se2-7 and displaying the result by 2 7-piece displays
- Working with a matrix keyboard (designing the keyboard and displaying the numbers read from the keyboard by 7-piece displays)
- Working with LCD (connecting LCD to microcontroller and displaying the information received from the keyboard by it) 9. Writing and reading data from EEPROM microcontroller memory
- Working with counter timer: Microcontroller in normal operation mode and CTC (flashing or two LEDs connected to two pins of one port that turn on and off alternately)
- Working with counter timers 0 and 1 (making digital frequency meter)
- Work with timer 2 in PWM mode (adjust LED brightness by adjusting motor speed by PWM wave)
- Working with a microcontroller analog comparator (turning on and off an LED by increasing or decreasing the voltage of one of the analog comparator inputs relative to the other input)
- Working with analog to digital microcontroller converter (temperature measurement by making a voltmeter with resistance meter and display on LCD)
- Working with the USART microcontroller interface (communication between two microcontrollers by communicating between a microcontroller and a computer via RS232 communication using the USART interface on the microcontroller side and the USART Serial Connection.NET Component or Hyper Terminal on the computer side)
- Working with SPI microcontroller interface (communication between two microcontrollers via SPI interface or writing and reading data in SD RAM)
