
# Microprocessors and Assembly Language

This course provides students with basic microprocessor and microcontroller knowledge. In a way that will enable them to design systems based on microprocessors and microcontrollers. A significant portion of this lesson is based on the 808688 microprocessor. Learning this microprocessor, in the simplicity of the structure compared to today's much more advanced processors, conveys important basic information of microprocessor design concepts to students and prepares them to learn more complex structures. At the same time, this course will introduce a brief overview of the more advanced Pentium microprocessor, such as the stability of addressing methods and the concepts of real and protected state operation, to show a brief overview of its differences with the 86 80 (optional) microprocessor. The course is dedicated to the introduction of AVR family microcontrollers so that students with the facilities built into microcontrollers and concepts in embedded systems, including the combination of memory types of programmable parallel ports, types of hardware and software interrupts and their prioritization Familiarize the timer for use in counting timing events and generate analog comparator PWM signals, analog-to-digital converters, and some types of serial communication protocols. In order to get acquainted with assembly language, in this course, while getting acquainted with the main concepts of assembly language, 8084 microprocessor assembly instructions and AVR family are introduced and assemblers and integrated development environments (IDE) will be introduced to them.
