
# The Theory of Formal Languages and Automata

This course aims to provide a proper understanding of the relationship between application software and hardware and resource management methods and algorithms for computer engineering students. In addition, students in this course will learn robust methods for managing low-level computer systems. In addition, designing such systems taking into account the characteristics and limitations of hardware and software, and improving the program's quality is another goal of this course. This course is a combination of theoretical and practical topics.
