Familiarity of students with the principles, definitions, concepts, applications, organizational and social effects, management concepts, foundations, and architecture of information technology. The broad scope of the application of Rabaneh forms the framework of information technology discussions, and the preconceptions of this technology consider the scope, social, economic, and cultural effects to be influential. In this first lesson, IT students are introduced to the principles, definitions, concepts, applications, organizational and social effects of the management concepts of this technology, its foundations, and architecture. Because computer and information technology engineers are the creators and promoters of new solutions in this field, they should be aware of the latest concepts, achievements, and areas of application of this technology in the world and in Iran. The superficial breadth of the concepts of this lesson, due to the depth of each topic in the following lessons, forms its structural form.
