Students can apply the essential concepts of relational database systems and can use and evaluate them systematically and in a qualified manner. The students have the expertise to systematically use a database system, starting from the conceptual design to the implementation design to the physical design. They can formulate even complex queries in SQL and have a basic understanding of logical and physical optimization based on relational algebra. Furthermore, they know how to safeguard a database application concerning recovery, concurrency control, and authorization. The course also covers database design methodology. main course topics are data models, the architecture of database systems, data definition and manipulation languages, database design methods, and the theory of data dependencies and relational normalization.
