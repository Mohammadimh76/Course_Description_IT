Familiarity of information skills with theoretical and practical topics of Fa-strategic studies in the fields of information technology management and planning in the organization and gaining knowledge of selecting the appropriate type of Wi-Fi strategic study for each organization according to its absorption capacity, using appropriate methods and producing solutions Transition with organizational methods using modifiable engineering patterns is one of the main objectives of this course. The second goal of the course is to understand the need to draw architectural plans and update them to move from the current situation to the desired conditions and integrate solution systems that are pioneers of national projects such as e-government. Improving the level of students' attitudes and gaining the ability to extract systemic solutions for the realization of organizational solutions will also become a necessary skill with practical exercises.
